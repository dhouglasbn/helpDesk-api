## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run user routes tests only
npm test -- tests/userRoutes.spec.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Configuration

- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support (ts-jest)
- **HTTP Testing**: Supertest for Express testing
- **Environment**: Node.js
- **Test Timeout**: 5 seconds per test
- **Environment Variables**: Pre-set for testing (JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL)

## Mock Tokens

The test suite uses JWT tokens with mock data for different user roles:

- Admin token: `{ id: 'admin-id-123', role: 'admin' }`
- Tech token: `{ id: 'tech-id-123', role: 'tech' }`
- Client token: `{ id: 'client-id-123', role: 'client' }`

These allow testing authorization logic without hitting the database.

## Notes

- Tests use `supertest` to make HTTP requests to Express app
- Validation errors may return 400 before reaching authorization checks
- Tests account for both authorization errors (403) and validation errors (400)
- All tests respect the requisites defined in `requisites.md`
